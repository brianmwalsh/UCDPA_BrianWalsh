Abstract
This project looks at the results of each of the 380 matches in the 2022/2023 Premier League Season. From this I wanted to summarise all the matches into a League Table and ultimately see which club won the Premier League, see if they were in fact the best club, and gain other useful insights. It also looks at a comparison between seasons and finally looks forward to the current season.


Introduction
I enjoy football and one of my strong beliefs is that you need to understand the base data in order to be confident and truly analyse and find useful insights.


Dataset
My main dataset is a .csv file containing historical data relating to match results for the English Premier League season 2022/2023 available on https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php. I chose this source as it contained the basic information I needed to create statistics. The source also contained results for previous seasons which I could also use for comparisons.
